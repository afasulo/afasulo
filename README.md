![Matrix Animation](matrix-code-animation-gif-free-animated-background-716.gif)

Systems engineer specializing in HPC, distributed systems, and low-level performance optimization with an eye towards security, automation, and resilience. 
I have 6+ years of consistent experience in system administration, network engineering, and low level programming. My background in low-level systems has built a strong intuition for troubleshooting complex architectures and engineering robust solutions. Built production tools at Sandia National Laboratories that reduced petabyte-scale data analysis from weeks to milliseconds and automated HPC infrastructure deployment. Currently exploring algorithmic theory, GPU computing, cryptographic protocols and many other things that grab my curiosity.

Currently completing B.S. in Computer Science & Mathematics (Dec 2025) while exploring GPU computing, Numerical computing, distributed systems, and cryptographic protocols.
