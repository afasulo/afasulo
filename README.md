![Matrix Animation](matrix-code-animation-gif-free-animated-background-716.gif)

Systems engineer specializing in HPC, distributed systems, and low-level performance optimization. Built production tools at Sandia National Laboratories that reduced petabyte-scale data analysis from weeks to milliseconds and automated HPC infrastructure deployment. Currently exploring algorithmic theory, GPU computing, and cryptographic protocols.
