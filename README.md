## Projects

### Advanced Algorithms & Theory
**[Advanced-Algorithms](https://github.com/afasulo/Advanced-Algorithms)** - Graduate-level algorithmic theory with applications to cryptography, blockchain consensus, and distributed systems. Includes FFT-based integer multiplication, zero-knowledge proofs, and Byzantine fault tolerance.

### High-Performance Computing
**[HPC_Class](https://github.com/afasulo/HPC_Class)** - Coursework and projects from HPC class covering parallel computing, GPU acceleration, and performance optimization.

**[numerical-computing](https://github.com/afasulo/numerical-computing)** - HPC scripts and numerical/scientific computing methods. Includes custom C functions for numerical algorithms.

**[HPL_GPU](https://github.com/afasulo/HPL_GPU)** - Research paper on running HPL benchmarks on H100 GPUs and performance analysis.

**[gnu-compiler-optimizations](https://github.com/afasulo/gnu-compiler-optimizations)** - Analysis of how GCC optimization levels (O0, O1, O2, O3) affect quicksort performance in C.

### Distributed Systems & Cryptography
**[Distributed-Systems-Crypto-Simulation](https://github.com/afasulo/Distributed-Systems-Crypto-Simulation)** - Quantitative analysis of content-oblivious cryptographic ordering protocols for MEV mitigation in DeFi using agent-based modeling.

**[crypto](https://github.com/afasulo/crypto)** - Coursework and resources from CS 591 - Economic Distributed Systems.

### Operating Systems & Systems Programming
**[operating-systems-code](https://github.com/afasulo/operating-systems-code)** - Programming projects covering OS principles including CPU virtualization (scheduling), memory virtualization, and concurrency problems.
