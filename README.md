Systems engineer specializing in HPC, distributed systems, and low-level performance optimization with an eye towards security, automation, and resiliance. 
I have 6+ years of consistent experience in system administration, network engineering, and low level programming. My background in low-level systems has built a strong intuition for troubleshooting complex architectures and engineering robust solutions. Built production tools at Sandia National Laboratories that reduced petabyte-scale data analysis from weeks to milliseconds and automated HPC infrastructure deployment. Currently exploring algorithmic theory, GPU computing, cryptographic protocols and many other things that grab my curiosity.

### **HPC, Profiling & Runtime**
- **[HPL_GPU](https://github.com/afasulo/HPL_GPU)** – Performance analysis of the HPL benchmark on **NVIDIA H100 GPUs**. Utilized **NVIDIA Nsight** and **GDB** for profiling and bottleneck detection.
- **[gnu-compiler-optimizations](https://github.com/afasulo/gnu-compiler-optimizations)** – Study of GCC optimization levels on binary efficiency, focusing on **build system** (Make/CMake) configurations.
- **[numerical-computing](https://github.com/afasulo/numerical-computing)** – Analysis of numerical stability and error propagation in scientific computing workflows.

### **Automation & Distributed Systems**
- **[Distributed-Systems-Crypto-Simulation](https://github.com/afasulo/Distributed-Systems-Crypto-Simulation)** – Agent-based modeling of MEV mitigation protocols.
- **[Advanced-Algorithms](https://github.com/afasulo/Advanced-Algorithms)** – Implementations of Zero-knowledge proofs, Byzantine consensus, and FFT multiplication using **MPI**.
- **[Nakamoto_Consensus_Tail_Bounds](LINK_TO_REPO)** – *Coming Soon* – Formal derivation of Chernoff bounds for Bitcoin orphan block rates.

### **Systems Programming**
- **[operating-systems-code](https://github.com/afasulo/operating-systems-code)** – CPU/memory virtualization and concurrency primitives.
- **[XGhostClip](https://github.com/afasulo/XGhostClip)** – An X11-style clipboard manager for macOS.
- **[binary-bomb-analysis](https://github.com/afasulo/binary-bomb-analysis)** – Reverse engineering and stack frame analysis exercises.
